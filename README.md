# Color Pallet Generator
### A Digital Artist's Tool



## Goal

The objective of this project is to make it easier for artists to create color pallets from any image. 
* Users can add any image from their local hard drive 
* Python will automatically find the colors in the image using the colorgram package.
* Users will be able to download the image and place it in their art programs, such as Adobe, Paint, Krita, or Toon Boom for easy access. 

## Installation

Clone the project and it should be ready to use if you have all the packages downloaded in your IDE. If you do not have the package, type the following in the command line: 

```zsh
pip install [package]
```

The project should work in Pycharm. I am looking to contribute this project into another program in the future.

Packages Used:
* Tkinter
* GhostWriter
* Pillow
* Colorgram
* Random
