# Color Pallet Generator
### A Digital Artist's Tool


#### Note: This project is still in the works


## Goal

The objective of this project is to make it easier for artists to create color pallets from any image. 
* Users can add any image from their local hard drive 
* Python will automatically find the colors in the image using the colorgram package.
* Users will be able to download the image and place it in their art programs, such as Adobe, Paint, Krita, or Toon Boom, for easy access.
